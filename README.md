# Remote Worker Manifesto

This is a working document to be community edited: pull requests are welcome.

1. Employers need to be told that no matter how cool their environment is, "there is no place like home".
2. Remote workers need laws passed to enable them to work, to be paid, and to be able to pay their taxes in a comprehensible way.
