# Remote Worker Manifesto

This is a working document to be community edited: pull requests are welcome.

1. Employers need to know that no matter how cool their environment is, "there is no place like home".
2. Remote workers need laws passed to enable them to work, to be paid, and to be able to pay their taxes in a comprehensible way.
3. Not having to worry about the person next to me the smells like smoke, the gossiping secretary, or the constant ringing of the telephone allows me to focus things *that matter*, like how my work contributes to the company's financial goals.
